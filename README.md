<!---------ABOUT SECTION START--------->
## üåê About 

Nautilus is a modding library that aims to enhance developer productivity by offering common helper utilities as easy to use and robust as possible.
Notable systems which Nautilus offers: Adding/editing items, implementing custom sprites & textures, custom audio, a Subnautica-styled mod configuration menu, and so much more! 

This project is a continuation of [SMLHelper](https://github.com/SubnauticaModding/Nautilus/tree/sml-2) with an improved codebase and maintainability. Nautilus offers all the features SML used to offer in a more robust implementation. Additionally, Nautilus took another route of managing handlers to fix many bugs and timing issues that were persistent in SML.  

We hope to keep improving the modding experience in Subnautica to allow developers to create mods more easily and eliminate the implementation concerns in the mod-making process. For more information on Nautilus and its capabilities, please refer to our [documentation](https://subnauticamodding.github.io/Nautilus).  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Nautilus will only receive continued support for the latest version of Subnautica
- #### If you are using the latest version of Subnautica (post [2025 patch](https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2025-patch)) or Below Zero, use [the latest release of Nautilus](https://github.com/SubnauticaModding/Nautilus/releases)
- #### If you are using the `march_2023` Steam branch, use [Nautilus pre.41](https://github.com/SubnauticaModding/Nautilus/releases/tag/1.0.0-pre.41)
- #### If you are using the `legacy` Steam branch, use [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

<!---------INSTALLATION SECTION START--------->
## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
1. Download the [Subnautica BepInEx Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1108). 
2. Extract/unzip the BepInEx x64 zip file to your game folder
   <!---- FYI these dropdowns have a really weird spacing issue, the line breaks are mandatory to keep formatting! ---->
   - <details><summary>Where is my Subnautica/game folder? (Click to expand)</summary>

      - Steam: &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica</code> <br>
      - Epic Games: &ensp; <code>C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Subnautica</code> <br>
      - Xbox PC: &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; <code>C:\XboxGames\Subnautica\Content</code> <br>
      ###### Note: the above paths are the default locations, yours may vary
    </details>
    
    - <details><summary>How do I extract the zip file? (Click to expand)</summary>

      - Extracting/unzipping a zip file is as simple as right clicking it, and selecting the `Extract here` prompt. We highly recommend the use of a zipping tool besides the Windows default one, such as [WinRAR](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm), or [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/download.html)
    </details>
3. Download Nautilus from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1262) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SubnauticaModding/Nautilus/releases)
4. Extract/unzip the Nautilus zip file to your `Subnautica\BepInEx` folder
5. Confirm your `Subnautica\BepInEx\plugins` now looks like this:
   ###### If it doesn't look like this, try figuring out where your Nautilus folder has gone, and move it into the plugins folder

7. Launch the game, and enjoy! *(a good way to confirm Nautilus has loaded is to check the game Options for a `Mods` tab)*

#### If you have any trouble installing the mod, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UpWuWwq), and explain whats going on in a help and support channel.
