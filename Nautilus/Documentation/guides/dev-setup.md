# Development Setup Guide

This article covers a step-by-step guide of setting up your pc for Subnautica mod development. Please note that this setup works on any
operating system, so if you're using a non-windows machine, don't worry! You're in the right place!  

> [!NOTE]
> Although we try to keep this guide as comprehensible as possible, we will not cover a C# tutorial. So a basic understanding of the language
> is still required. [.NET Academy](https://dotnetcademy.net) covers the basics in a simple interactable tutorial.
> If you need a more in-depth C# tutorial, the [Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8) video is a good start.

To start developing, you will need to install some tools first:
1. Latest .NET SDK
2. An integrated development environment (IDE)
3. BepInEx 5.4.21
4. Nautilus


## .NET SDK
.NET software development kit (SDK) is the main component of starting to write C# code. The SDK will take care of compiling our code, as well as enable
the latest C# version features.  
In Nautilus we always make sure to update to the latest C# versions. To enable numerous inspection warnings and convenience while working with Nautilus, we recommend you to update the .NET SDK to the latest version.  

> [!TIP]
> Microsoft usually schedules their .NET Core releases around November every year.

To install .NET SDK:
1. Head to the [.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
2. Select the latest recommended .NET SDK  
![dotnet-sdk](../images/guides/dotnet-sdk.png)
3. Download and run the installer. A restart may be needed to take place afterward.

To ensure that the SDK has installed correctly, open a terminal and run the following line:
```bash
dotnet --version
```

Output:
```bash
7.0.102
```

## Picking an IDE
The top 3 IDEs for writing C# code are the following:
- [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community) - Free, great IDE designed for .NET development (Windows and Mac only)
- [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider) - Paid, outstanding IDE, incredible code-completion and code suggestions with the power of ReSharper, cross-platform
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Free, multi-purpose editor, cross-platform, can be used for C# development with plugins.

## Installing IDE

# [Visual Studio Community](#tab/vs)
1. Download the installer from the [Visual Studio download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community) and run it
2. Inside the Visual Studio installer, ensure the `.NET Desktop Development` component is selected, then proceed with the installation.  
![vs-install](../images/guides/vs-install.png)

# [JetBrains Rider](#tab/rider)
1. Download the installer from the [JetBrains Rider download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/)
2. Run the installer and follow the wizard steps.

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)
1. Download the installer from the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and run it
2. Install the [.NET extension pack](vscode:extension/ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-pack). This pack includes these extensions:
   - [C# for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
   - [Ionide for F#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp)
   - [Jupyter Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
   - [Polyglot Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

You can also install extensions separately.

## Installing BepInEx
BepInEx is a mod loader that we use to load Subnautica mods to the game. We recommend using the [Subnautica BepInEx Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1108) as it's configured specifically for the game.
The installation process is explained in the provided link.

## Installing Nautilus
1. Download Nautilus from one of [Nexus Mods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), [Submodica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SubnauticaModding/Nautilus/releases).
2. Drop and drop the `plugins` folder in the zip file to: `PathToSubnautica\BepInEx\`

## Installing Subnautica Modding templates
Since the project setup can be quite tedious for experienced developers and confusing for new-comers, we have published a series of templates to help you setup your projects more easily.  

To install the template, run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
dotnet new -i Subnautica.Templates
```

Once the install is completed, you will receive an output similar to the message below displaying the process as successful.
```bash
Template Name                             Short Name      Language  Tags
----------------------------------------  --------------  --------  ---------------------------------------------
Subnautica Empty Template                 snmod_empty     [C#]      SNModding/Subnautica/Mod
Subnautica Nautilus Template              snmod_nautilus  [C#]      SNModding/Subnautica/Mod/Nautilus
Subnautica Template                       snmod           [C#]      SNModding/Subnautica/Mod
Subnautica: Below Zero Empty Template     bzmod_empty     [C#]      SNModding/Subnautica: Below Zero/Mod
Subnautica: Below Zero Nautilus Template  bzmod_nautilus  [C#]      SNModding/Subnautica: Below Zero/Mod/Nautilus
Subnautica: Below Zero Template           bzmod           [C#]      SNModding/Subnautica: Below Zero/Mod
```
  

Below is a description of what each of these templates represent:

| Template Name                    | Short Name (ID) | Description                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subnautica Template              | snmod           | Contains all the essential configurations, dependencies, and a basic `Plugin.cs` with the Logger and harmony patcher.                     |
| Subnautica Empty Template        | snmod_empty     | Contains all the essential configurations and dependencies with no additional files.                                                      |
| Subnautica Nautilus Template     | snmod_nautilus  | Contains all the essential configurations, dependencies with Nautilus installed and a simple example demonstrating the usage of Nautilus. |

The Subnautica: Below Zero templates contain the exact same configurations as their corresponding Subnautica versions, except they install BZ dependencies instead.

## Creating a new mod project
Once you installed the templates, they will appear among other templates in the "Create new project" section of your favorite IDE. 
![vs-template-default](../images/guides/vs-template-default.png)

You can also create the project using CLI:

# [Subnautica](#tab/sn1)
```bash
dotnet new snmod -n MyBeautifulMod
```

Now you can add more code to the project, then build and put the compiled dll in Subnautica/BepInEx/plugins/.

# [Subnautica: Below Zero](#tab/bz)
```bash
dotnet new bzmod -n MyBeautifulMod
```

Now you can add more code to the project, then build and put the compiled dll in SubnauticaZero/BepInEx/plugins/.
